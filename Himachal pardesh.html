  <h3>About Kullu</h3>
 <img src="th.jpg" height="100" width="250" alt="people of Kullu"/>
  <h4 ><b>Inside  KULLU</b></h4> 
<div class="ASAS">
                    Majestic Himalayas lies Kullu, a valley that's as rich in culture as it is in natural beauty. Known as the ‘Valley of Gods, Kullu is a tapestry of lush landscapes, ancient traditions, and warm-hearted people. 
                    Join me on a journey to explore the life and culture of Kullu and its people.
                    The residents of Kullu are known for their simple yet profound way of life. 
                    Rooted in their connection with nature, they lead lives that are a harmonious blend of tradition and modernity. Agriculture and handicrafts form the backbone of their livelihood,
                        with the famous Kullu shawls representing their artistic heritage
                       Himachalis are known for their warm hospitality and simple living. The majority of the population lives in villages and is engaged in agriculture, 
                       horticulture, and pastoralism2. The traditional houses are often two-storied with terraced farms, and each village has a temple that plays a central role in the community's spiritual life3.
                       The culture is reflected in the handicrafts, such as the famous Kullu shawls, and in the local music and dance that celebrate gods and festivals</span>

          <ul type ="square">
         <P style="color:black;">Kullu Dussehra is the renowned International Mega Dussehra 
                festival observed in the month of October in Himachal Pradesh 
                state in northern India. Wherein more than 4-5 lakh people visit
                 the fair from all across the Globe. It is celebrated in the Dhalpur
                  maidan in the Kullu valley. Dussehra at Kullu commences on the tenth
                   day of the rising moon, i.e. on 'Vijay Dashmi' day itself and continues
                    for seven days. Its history dates back to the 17th century when local King Jagat Singh 
                    installed an idol of Raghunath on his throne as a mark of penance. After this, god Raghunath 
                    was declared as the ruling deity of the Valley. The State government has accorded the status 
                    of International festival to the Kullu Dussehra,

            <h2>TRADITION</h2> 
        <img src="JWELLERY.jpg" height="300" width="300" alt="jewelry"/>
        <p style="color:black;">:It's interesting to note how the jewelry of Kullu has evolved along the
             years. Silver is still the principle base metal used for making Jewelry however the style and 
             weight of the ornaments have undergone change. Nowadays the women of Kullu valley venture out 
             for household work and are increasingly engaged in professional activities too. Consequently 
             the jewelry has grown lighter and more manageable. A good example of this is the Laung (a big 
             nose ornament) which has been changed into Tilli (a small nose stud).
            Many jewelry pieces like the Kangnu (tiger mouthed bracelet) have inspired other jewelry making customs of different states. Bengali women for example wear the gold Bala with tiger mouths that is heavily inspired by Kangnnu. The Mendkumala has now gradually evolved to become the more contemporary Matarhar.
            Each family in Kullu fiercely hordes its collection of jewelry and this is passed down from generation to generation. The Balu is an ornament which is always gifted to the bride by her maternal uncle.  The jewelry making trade in Kullu is generally a family run business which runs down from generation to generation.</p>

            <h2 style="color: gold;">The Gaddi Lands of Chamba</h2>
            <img src="gaddi sepherds.jpg" height="300" width="400" alt="Chamba gaddi sepherds"/>
               
        <h4 style="color: green;">What describe Chamba there people?</h4>
        <p> No,Chamba was found in old text ,A variation of this origin of Chamba is that it originated as a hermitage which Champavati,
             a devout Hindu, used to frequent.The king, being suspicious of his daughter's fidelity,
            one day investigated and followed her to the hermitage, but surprisingly he found neither
             his daughter nor the hermit there. Suddenly he was said to have heard a voice which informed 
             him that his suspicions were ill-founded, admonishing him and informing him that his daughter
              had been taken away from him permanently as a punishment for his lack of trust in her morals.
               The King, fully chastened, sought redemption for his sin by expanding the hermitage into a temple,
                named in his daughter's honour and built a city around the temple. Today this temple, called the 
                Champavati Temple, belongs to the Royal family and the King's daughter is venerated as a goddess.
                 Every year, since 935, the Minjar festival or fair has been held. 
            It lasts for 21 days, coinciding with the first day of Baisakhi.</p>
